o Add two new options to invocation of Make:

  --no-builtin-rules                     \
  --no-builtin-variables                 \

  This will end up NOT being an out-of-the-box experience, so it needs
  to be an optional setting.

o Configure Scons to not checksum files for out-of-date checking.

  This is also not an out-of-the-box configuration, so it needs to be
  done optionally.

o Create graphs of runtime numbers, based on all the variable factors
  of the system (such as parallelism, number of modules, size of
  modules, etc.)

o Add Bazel generator.
